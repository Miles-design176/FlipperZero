# System32 Deletion Prank

This prank simulates the deletion of the **System32** folder on your computer. It downloads a ZIP file, extracts it, and runs a fake PowerShell script that pretends to delete **System32**. Afterward, the computer "powers up" as if it's recovered.

## How It Works

1. Opens the **Run** dialog (`Win + R`).
2. Downloads and extracts a ZIP file with a fake script.
3. Simulates **System32** deletion, then "recovers" the computer.

> **Note**: This prank is harmless and only for fun. It does not actually delete any files.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script.

### Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **PowerShell**
